# pysound 0.3 beta


## THIS IS A VERY BAREBONES VERSION. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH FUNCTIONALITY. (tho you can contribute to future updates!)

### pysound is a basic soundboard made using python and pygame.

### (comes with 2 sample sounds)

## setup: clone/download the git repo

#### use it however you want!

# q&a:

## q: i want to add more sounds

## a: to do that:
 ### 1: drop your sounds in the "sounds" directory **(make sure they're .mp3 or .ogg, this is due to pygame limitations)**
    
 ### 2: edit the "sounds.txt" file to include your sound
 ### for example, if you added a sound named "sound.mp3", add the line "sounds/sound.mp3" to the file
