# pysound 0.1 demo


## THIS IS A VERY BAREBONES VERSION. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH FUNCTIONALITY. (tho you can contribute to future updates!)

### pysound is a basic soundboard made using python and pygame.

### (comes with 2 sample sounds)

#### use it however you want!

# q&a:

## q: i want to add more sounds

## a: currently, there isn't a very simple way of adding sounds. but what you can do now is drop sound files in the sounds directory (SHOULD BE .MP3!) named sound1, sound2, sound3 (...) and edit the main.py file to add them (starting from line 23)
